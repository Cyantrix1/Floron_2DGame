<h2> A Game Focused on OOP and Functional Programming </h2>

<h3> By: Nicholas Heath</h3>

This project follows the tutorial by YouTuber Ryisnow who does an amazing job explaining how to make a 2D game.

Right now, I'm following each video and adding my own spin too it.

Once I'm done watching the tutorials, I will continue to add more of my own original code to improve this game
